Bootle: A Wordle clone in a boot sector (or COM file)

This programs replicates the Wordle game in a boot sector, because
of the space limitations it only contains 57 words. Also because
the word list is so tiny, it doesn't check if it is a valid word.

In case you want a full 2500 word list, there is Bootle v2, it
contains a loader to retrieve the dictionary from the disk
(it generates a 360 KB image), so it can work WITHOUT operating
system. Also there is a COM file if the prospect of not having an
operating system bothers you :P

It can be run as a COM file or put into a boot sector of a floppy
disk to be run.

It's compatible with 8088 (the original IBM PC).

If you want to assemble it, you must download the Netwide Assembler
(nasm) from www.nasm.us

Use this command line:

  nasm -f bin bootle.asm -Dcom_file=1 -o bootle.com
  nasm -f bin bootle.asm -Dcom_file=0 -o bootle.img

Tested with VirtualBox for Mac OS X running Windows XP running this
program, it also works with DosBox and probably with qemu:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -fda bootle.img

Enjoy it!
